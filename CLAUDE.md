### Section 8: Frequently Asked Questions
**Word Count:** 500-600 words
**Target Keywords:** ham radio FAQ, ham radio questions

**FAQ Items (schema.org FAQPage markup):**

**Q1: Do I need a license to buy a ham radio?**
A: No. Anyone can purchase ham radio equipment. You only need a license to transmit. Many people buy a radio first to listen and learn while studying for their exam.

**Q2: How hard is the Technician exam?**
A: Most people pass with 10-20 hours of study. The question pool is public, so you're studying the actual test questions. Pass rate is approximately 80% for first-time test takers.

**Q3: How much does it cost to get started in ham radio?**
A: Budget $100-150 total: FCC license fee ($35), exam fee ($0-15), and a basic radio ($25-100). You can be on the air for under $100 with a budget radio.

**Q4: What's the difference between HF, VHF, and UHF?**
A: HF (High Frequency) travels long distances via sky wave - good for worldwide contacts. VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High Frequency) are line-of-sight and used for local communication via repeaters.

**Q5: How far can a handheld ham radio reach?**
A: Directly (simplex): 2-10 miles depending on terrain. Via repeater: 25-100+ miles. Range depends heavily on antenna, location, and repeater access.

**Q6: Is Baofeng legal to use in the US?**
A: Yes, for amateur radio use by licensed operators. The FCC has fined Baofeng for marketing radios to unlicensed users, but the radios themselves are legal for hams to use.

**Q7: Can I use ham radio in emergencies without a license?**
A: The FCC allows unlicensed transmission only for immediate threats to life or property when no other communication is available. This is an emergency exception, not a loophole.

**Q8: How long does it take to get my call sign after passing?**
A: Typically 1-2 weeks. Some VECs submit results same-day, others take a few days. Once your call sign appears in the FCC ULS database, you can transmit.

**Q9: Do I need to learn Morse code?**
A: No. The Morse code requirement was eliminated in 2007. You can get any license class without knowing code. Many hams still learn it as an optional skill.

**Q10: What is a repeater?**
A: A repeater receives your signal and retransmits it at higher power from an elevated location. This extends the range of handheld and mobile radios from a few miles to 50+ miles.
